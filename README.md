For it to work you should clone this repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/GFA03/Graph-AF.git
```
and clone the Pybind11 transpiler inside the Graph-AF folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git
```
then the last commands are:
```
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Congratulations! Now you've got project running. For the implementation of the class Graph and its algorithms you can check the C++ code, while for the visualisation you can check the python code.
